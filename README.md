This GitHub repo contains the default token list used in the Pond on Solana interface.

Adding a token
To request that we add a token to the list, [Add Token](https://github.com/Pond-Foundation/tokenlists/issues/new?assignees=&labels=token+request&template=token-request.md&title=Add+%7BTOKEN_SYMBOL%7D%3A+%7BTOKEN_NAME%7D).


ChainID: Use `101` 


Disclaimer
Note filing an issue does not guarantee addition to this default token list. This is an open list of tokens available on various DEX's across Solana. This isn't an exchange listing. We do not review token addition requests in any particular order, and we do not guarantee that we will review your request to add the token to the default list.
